Database profiles \u2693\ufe0e The server mode must know which database profile it is connected to. There are two ways of setting up a database profile: First, the database profile can be created manually. Therefore, he following information is required: IP address, WebClient URL and database name. Please note that /api is appended to the end of the IP address. It is also possible that the database profile is filled out automatically. For this, you need to log on to a database via WebClient. By clicking on the add-on in the WebClient, its profile can be taken over. Now all necessary information such as profile name, IP address, WebClient and database name are transferred. The server mode benefits \u2693\ufe0e The server mode offers the following advantages: No terminal service is required in terminal server operation SSO Agent is no longer required Be aware Please note that SSO applications only work via SSO agent.

Password Safe integrates the possibility to bring in users and roles from Azure. To use users and roles from multiple Azure ADs, you can create multiple profiles. Differences to the LDAP connection \u2693\ufe0e The connection to the Azure AD differs in one special point from the connection to a conventional Active Directory. While Password Safe queries the users, groups, and roles actively from the conventional AD, the Azure AD is pushing them automatically to our server. For this a so-called SCIM service is used. To login to Password Safe, after entering the username a popup opens for the authentication with the entered Microsoft account. Here, a possible configured second factor is also requested. The authentication is handled via the Open ID Connect protocol. Linking Azure AD \u2693\ufe0e Below you will find instructions on how to connect Azure AD to Password Safe. In the Azure portal, go to the management page of your Azure Active Directory. Use an account with administrative permissions for this.

It not only imports users, organizational units and roles but also their links and affiliations. It can be synchronized to update the information and affiliations. In this scenario, Active Directory is used as a leading system . Relevant rights \u2693\ufe0e The following options are required to add new profiles.

The domain field is used to define which domain is to be read. The value entered here will also be used for authentication if no alternative spellings have been saved under Other domain names . A local user (for example, the administrator) or an already imported user must be specified. The data will be imported under that user\u2019s name. A user is required to access the AD. The user should be formatted as follows: Domain\\User. It must have access to the AD. Corresponding user password (domain password) for the user. * Direct search is recommended for very large domain trees. The tree structure is omitted, elements can then only be found and selected via the search. By activating the checkbox Restrict user import to role members only , a simplified mode is activated. In this mode, only AD users who are members of at least one role are imported. As soon as they are no longer a member of at least one role, they are deleted from Password Safe. By activating the checkbox Force update on next synchronization , ALL records will be updated on the next synchronization, regardless of whether the record has changed in the Active Directory or not. (This checkbox is automatically activated when you have edited the other responsible users and is deactivated again after the next synchronization). The LDAP filter can be used to directly specify an AD path as an entry point via an LDAP query. Various security options \u2013 so-called AuthenticationTypes Enumeration ( Flags ) \u2013 can be selected for the connection of the AD to Password Safe: Secure SecureSocketsLayer ReadOnlyServer Signing Sealing Hint The first two options are already activated by default when configuring a new profile. If a connection is not possible, deactivate SecureSocketsLayer and try again. Other responsible users or roles can be used to define who is permitted to carry out the synchronization with the AD. The option Other domain names can be used to save alternative spellings of the login domain. These must correspond to the spelling entered in the login window. For example, if a connection is being established to the domain jupiter.local or an IP address, the login can only be carried out with jupiter\\user if jupiter has been saved here. Be Aware The master key is added in form of a certificate. It is essential to back up the generated certificate! If the database is being moved to another server, the certificate also needs to be transferred! Further information can be found in the section Certificates . Hint You can now use the option to integrate a RADIUS server. Read more in the following chapter . Import \u2693\ufe0e You can start the import directly in the ribbon. A wizard guides the user through the entire operation. Organizational structure \u2693\ufe0e First, an organizational unit is selected for the import. If there are no organizational units in the database yet, as in this example, the data is imported into the main organizational unit . Active Directory objects \u2693\ufe0e In the next step, select the profile you will use to import the data. Then, select organizational units and/or users for the import. A search is available for this purpose. As you can see, the organizational units Jupiter and Contoso contain items to be imported. The organizational units themselves will not be imported. The group 1099 Contractor is imported including all sub-elements. The check next to the group Accounting indicates that the group itself will be imported along with some of its sub-elements. The ticks in the last column ensure that the elements are observed in future synchronization sequences. There are different symbols which indicate the elements to be imported. The element itself and all possible sub-elements will be imported The element itself and some of its sub-elements will be imported The element will not be imported; however, it contains elements that will be imported Right-clicking in the list will launch a context menu. It provides helpful functions for the selection of the individual elements. Hint If individual users cannot be selected for import, they have already been imported via an end-to-end encrypted profile. In the lower area you can specify whether the users just selected for import should be created as Light or Full users. Summary \u2693\ufe0e The last page summarizes which objects will be edited and in what form. It specifies the names of the elements along with their descriptions. The Status column specifies whether the object is added, updated, or disabled. The last column specifies the organizational unit into which the element is imported. The number of objects can be seen at the bottom. Importing \u2693\ufe0e The server imports data in the background. The individual elements then appear in the list one by one. This may take some time, depending on the amount of import data. If the import was terminated, this is symbolized by a hint. Imported users and organizational units \u2693\ufe0e The users and organizational units imported in Masterkey mode cannot be edited in Password Safe. Therefore, any changes must be made in AD and synchronized. AD thus becomes the leading system. Affiliations to roles are also synchronized and must be set in the AD. In organizational units or roles created in Password Safe, the users can be included directly in Password Safe. Rights \u2693\ufe0e The rights will be issued as follows during the import or synchronization. New objects \u2693\ufe0e User Groups Roles Are rights inherited from the OU? If no preset has been saved If no preset has been saved No Are rights applied from a preset? If a preset has been saved If a preset has been saved No Is the \"add\" right issued?

All with the \"authorize\" right None All with the \"authorize\" right Hint If a user is imported, he will be given those roles that he also had in AD insofar as these roles already exist in Password Safe or have also been imported. Logging into Password Safe \u2693\ufe0e Users who are imported using this mode can log in with the domain password. Please note that no domain needs to be specified when logging in. Of course, the login process can also be supplemented with multifactor authentication . Hint Logging on using Kerberos works \"automatically\". As long as the corresponding Kerberos server is accessible, the users in the domain authenticate themselves via Kerberos using their domain password. If the logon via Kerberos does not work \u2013 e.g. due to incorrect configuration of the domain controller \u2013 the logon via the NTLM protocol is attempted. However, these are all settings that have to be made on the domain controller and have nothing to do with Password Safe. Be Aware Logging on to Password Safe using SSO via Kerberos is currently not possible. Permissions to imported objects \u2693\ufe0e The rights to be issued to imported users are explained in the following example: In Master Key mode, all users will be issued with the read right. The responsible user will be issued with all rights and the key. This ensures that he can also synchronize or change the user in the future Other responsible users are issued with the same rights as the responsible user The Master Key for the Active Directory profile will also be issued with all rights and keys as it will be used for the synchronization Finally, users will be issued with the rights for themselves Hint All users and roles issued with rights to the imported object also receive its rights key. Synchronization \u2693\ufe0e During synchronization, all relevant information for users, organizational units and roles (names, email, etc.) is updated. Changed affiliations for roles are adjusted. Likewise, users are activated or deactivated according to the settings in the AD. If the membership of organizational units is to be changed, this can be done by Drag & Drop . New users and correspondingly defined roles are imported. Hint If the tick was not set in the Synchronization column when a user is imported, no changes are made.

The Passwords module provides administrators and users with central access to the passwords for the purpose of handling this sensitive data that requires protection. Search filters in combination with color-highlighted tags enable very focussed work. Various approaches can be used to help apply the desired permissions to objects. Furthermore, the ergonomic structure of the module helps all users to use Password Safe in an efficient and targeted manner. Prerequisite \u2693\ufe0e The following user right is required for adding new passwords: Can add new passwords Module-specific ribbon functions \u2693\ufe0e The ribbon offers access to all possible actions relevant to the situation at all times. Especially within the \"Passwords\" module, the ribbon plays a key role due to the numerous module-specific functions. General information on the subject of the ribbon is available in the relevant section. The module-specific ribbon functions will be explained below. New \u2693\ufe0e New password : New passwords can be added via this icon in the ribbon, via the context menu that is accessed using the right mouse button and via the shortcut (Ctrl + N). The next step is to select a suitable form . Open : Opens the object marked in list view and provides further information about the record in the reading pane . Delete : Deletes the object marked in list view . A log file entry is created (see logbook ). Reveal : The function Reveal can be used for all records that have a password field. The passwords in the reading pane will be revealed. In the example, the passwords have been revealed and can be hidden again with the Hide button. Actions \u2693\ufe0e Notifications : Defining notifications enables a constant flow of information about any type of interaction. The issuing of notifications is carried out in the module designed for this purpose. Duplicate : Duplicating creates an exact copy of the record in a new tab. Move : Moves the record marked in list view to another organizational structure. Favorite : The selected record is marked as a favorite. It is possible to switch between all records and favorites at any time. Quick view : A modal window opens for the selected record for 15 seconds and displays all available information including the value of the password . Change form : It is possible to change the form used for individual records. \"Mapping\" of the previous form fields can be directly carried out in the process. Permissions \u2693\ufe0e Permissions : The drop-down menu can be used to set both password permissions and also form field permissions. This method only allows the manual setting of permissions for data (see authorization concept ). Password masking : Masking passwords that need to be protected from unauthorized users is an important feature of the security concept in Password Safe. Seal : The multi-eye principle in Password Safe is covered in its own section. Seals . Clipboard \u2693\ufe0e The clipboard is a key element in the ribbon. This only exists in the \"Passwords\" module. Clicking on the desired form field for a record in the ribbon will copy it to the clipboard. The message in the style of the \"Balloon Tips\" in Windows shows that the password has now been saved in the clipboard for 300 seconds. (Note: the time until the clipboard is cleared is 60 seconds by default. In the present case, this has been adjusted via the user settings.) Start \u2693\ufe0e Conveniently working with passwords is only possible via the efficient usage of automated accesses via RDP, SSH, general Windows applications or websites. This makes it possible to dispense with (unsecure) entries via \"copy & paste\". Open web page : If an URL is saved in the record, this menu option can be used to directly open it. Applications : If applications have been linked to records, they can be directly opened via the \"start menu\". Extras \u2693\ufe0e Create external link : This option creates an external link for the record marked in list view. A number of different options can be selected: Be Aware If several sessions are opened on a client, an external link is always called in the first session. History : This icon opens the history for those records selected in list view in a new tab. Due to the comprehensive recording of historical versions of passwords, it is now possible to compare several versions with one another. Print : This option can be used to open the print function. Export : It is possible to export all the selected records and also the data defined by the filter to a .csv file. Change form : This option can be used to assign a new form to the selected passwords. Settings : The password settings are described in a separate section.

To make the selection process as easy as possible, a preview of the form fields included in the form is shown on the right hand side. In this example, you can see that the \"Password\" form marked on the left contains three form fields \"Name\", \"User name\" and \"Password\". Forms thus act as templates according to which their information is saved. (Management of the forms including issuing permissions and editing existing forms is covered in a separate section ) Entering data \u2693\ufe0e The window for creating a new record always open in a separate tab. As can be seen below, the corresponding form fields for the previously selected form can now be filled. Password fields deserve special mention here because they can be handled differently based on password rules . The record can be saved via the ribbon when all fields have been filled. Validity and tags \u2693\ufe0e Irrespective of the selected form, it is always possible to define the validity and tags for a record. Both values are optional. The validity defines an end date until which the record is valid. This information can be evaluated e.g. in the logbook or in reports. It is thus possible to create a list of all expired passwords for a user or an authorized entity. However, it is not possible to limit the usability of expired passwords for security reasons. Tags are freely definable properties of records that can be used as search criteria. This also allows thematically linked information to be grouped together. Setting permissions for new records \u2693\ufe0e In principle, there are various approaches for setting permissions for newly created records. All of them have already been described in the Authorization concept section. It is important to note here that manual setting of permissions is only possible after saving a record. Automatic permissions are set before the record is saved. In this context, the selection of the organizational structure and the permissions for a record are important aspects. Manual setting of permissions : If you want to manually set permissions for the record, select the organizational structure in which the record should be saved. After saving the record, the permissions can be manually amended via the permissions tab in the ribbon . If you only want to create a personal record for which no other user will receive permissions, simply select your own organizational structure and conclude the process with \"save\" via the ribbon. Hint If any kind of automatic permissions have been activated for the selected OU, this will always be prioritized. Be Aware Even when creating private records, inheritance of permissions based on the logged-in user can also be activated as an option. This option is described in a separate section . Hint The user right Allow sharing of personal passwords can be used to define that personal passwords cannot be released to other users. Automatic setting of permissions : Automatic setting of permissions is carried out before the record is saved. Irrespective of whether predefined rights or rights inheritance is being used, the configuration is always carried out in the organizational structure or permissions area.

All of them have already been described in the Authorization concept section. It is important to note here that manual setting of permissions is only possible after saving a record. Automatic permissions are set before the record is saved. In this context, the selection of the organizational structure and the permissions for a record are important aspects. Manual setting of permissions : If you want to manually set permissions for the record, select the organizational structure in which the record should be saved. After saving the record, the permissions can be manually amended via the permissions tab in the ribbon . If you only want to create a personal record for which no other user will receive permissions, simply select your own organizational structure and conclude the process with \"save\" via the ribbon. Hint If any kind of automatic permissions have been activated for the selected OU, this will always be prioritized. Be Aware Even when creating private records, inheritance of permissions based on the logged-in user can also be activated as an option. This option is described in a separate section . Hint The user right Allow sharing of personal passwords can be used to define that personal passwords cannot be released to other users. Automatic setting of permissions : Automatic setting of permissions is carried out before the record is saved. Irrespective of whether predefined rights or rights inheritance is being used, the configuration is always carried out in the organizational structure or permissions area.

Roles are a great way to efficiently manage multiple users without losing the overview. We've created multiple methods to manually or automatically manage your permissions. Alongside the definition of manual and automatic setting of permissions, the (optional) setting of protective mechanisms forms part of the authorization concept. The protective mechanisms are thus downstream of the permissions. The interrelationships between all of these elements are illustrated in the following diagram. Note Applying some form of permissions is obligatory . Applying a protective mechanism is optional . Note The configuration of visibility is a technical part of the permissions process. However, this mechanism has a \u201cprotective character\u201d and is thus listed under protective mechanisms. Basic mechanics of the permission concept \u2693\ufe0e These three pillars are irrevocable and always impact permissions of every type. The three pillars of the permission concept \u2693\ufe0e The reproduction of company-specific permission structures can vary greatly in terms of effort. The basic concept is based on only a few rules which always apply without exception. Despite the innumerable individual adjustment screws, these basic rules can be summarized in three essential steps. 1. Permissions only for users or roles \u2693\ufe0e If the permission for a data record is to be defined, there are basically only two possibilities: Permission for a user Permission for a role A role is technically nothing more than a summary of multiple users with the same permissions. It is, of course, a good idea to manage these roles in accordance with your company\u2019s activities. The role \u201cAdministrators\u201d can therefore be provided with more extensive authorizations than, for example, the role \u201cSales Assistance\u201d. This role-based inheritance allows the organization to maintain the overview in a larger corporate structure as well as a simple procedure when adding new employees. Instead of having to entitle him individually, this is simply added to his role. It is obvious to proceed with the organization of accesses using the concept of roles as a basis and only to grant rights individually to employees in exceptional cases. The unplanned absence of personnel must also be taken into account in such concepts. Working with roles defuses such risks significantly. Note Permissions are always granted to only one user or role! 2. Membership in roles \u2693\ufe0e The key point is membership in a role. If an employee can use the authorizations according to the roles assigned to him, he must be a member of the role . Only members see the records that have been authorized for the role. Note A small technical digression into the nature of the encryption can be very helpful with the basic understanding. Each role has a key pair. The first key is used to encrypt data. Access to this information is only possible with the second key. The membership in a role is equivalent to this second key. 3. Membership vs. permissions for roles \u2693\ufe0e The admin user in Password Safe must pay particular attention to the interplay between users and roles. This dynamics is crucial for understanding the concept of authorization, in order to ensure maximum software adaptability to any corporate structure. The following diagram illustrates this with an example of two users. User 1 is a member of the role, and is therefore authorized for all records that are assigned to the role. However, it has only \u201cread rights\u201d for the role itself. This means, it can see the role, but cannot \u201cEdit, move, or delete\u201d it. User 2 has all rights for the role. It can add additional users to the role by means of \u201cauthorize\u201d. The crucial point, however, is that it is not a member of the role. It cannot, therefore, see any records for which the role is authorized. In practice, the first user would be a classic user that is assigned, for example, to the Sales role by the administrators, and can view the records accordingly. The second user could be one of those administrators. This user has extensive rights for the role. It can edit it, and add users to it. However, it cannot see any data that is assigned to sales. It lacks membership in the role. Note As a member of a role, it must have at least the \u201cread\u201d right for the role! Specific example and configuration \u2693\ufe0e Similar to the previous section Membership vs. permissions for roles , the configuration of a role will be illustrated using two users. The configuration is performed in the \"Roles\" module . By double-clicking on the role \u201cIT-Consultants\u201d in the list view , you can open their detailed view. The user \u201cHolste\u201d is a member of the role and can, therefore, access those records for which the role has permissions . He has the obligatory read right for the role, which is the basic requirement in order to be a member of the role. Which exact rights it has to the data record is not defined within the role! This is set out in the following section . The user \u201cAdministrator\u201d has all rights to the role, but is not a member! Thus, it cannot see any records that are authorized for the role. However, it has all rights to the role and can therefore print, assign other users to the role, and delete them. This example clearly shows the advantages of the concept. The complete separation of administrative users from regular users brings significant advantages. Of course, one does not necessarily exclude the other. An administrator can, of course, have full access to the role and also be a member in it!

This method of setting permissions is thus carried out separately for every record \u2013 this process is not as recommended for newly created data. If you want to work effectively in the long term, the automatic setting of permissions should be used. However, the manual setting of permissions is generally used when editing already existing records. Adding additional users with permissions \u2693\ufe0e In the previous section, it was clarified that permissions are granted either directly to the user or to several users grouped in a role. With this knowledge, the permissions can be set manually. In the \"Passwords\" module , there are three different ways to access the permissions in the list view: Icon in the ribbon Context menu of a data record (right-click) Icon at the right edge of the reading pane Note The icon on the right of the reading pane shows the information whether the record is personal or public. In case of personal data records, the user that is logged on is the only one who has permissions! The author is created with all permissions for the record. As described in the Permission Concept , you can now add roles and users. 'Right click - Add' inside the userlist or use the ribbon \"User and roles\" to add a user. The filter helps you to quickly find those users who should be granted permissions for the record in just a few steps. The search filter opens in a separate tab and can be configured as usual. Multiple selection is also enabled. It allows to add several users via the Windows standard Ctrl/Shift + left mouse button. Set and remove permissions \u2693\ufe0e By default, all added users or roles receive only the \u201cRead\u201d permission on the record. The \u201cRead\u201d permission at the beginning is sufficient to view the fields of the data record and to use the password. \"Write\" permission allows you to edit a data record. The permission \u201cAuthorize\u201d is necessary to authorize other users to the record . This is also a requirement for the configuration of a seal . Transferring permissions \u2693\ufe0e A simple right-click on a user can be used to copy and transfer permission configurations of users or roles to others in the context menu. In this context, the use of permission templates is also very practical. In the \u201cTemplate\u201d area of \u200b\u200bthe ribbon, you can save configured permissions, including all users, and reuse them for other records. The transfer of permissions and their reuse can be an important building block to create and maintain entitlement integrity. This method cannot rule out misconfigurations, but it will minimize the risk significantly. Of course, the correct configuration of these templates is a prerequisite. The add permission \u2693\ufe0e The \u201cadd\" permission holds a special position in the authorization concept. This permission controls whether a user/role is permitted e.g. to create a new record within an organisational structure. Consequently, this permission can only be set in the organisational structure module. More\u2026 The owner permission \u2693\ufe0e The \"owner\" permission can be set for a user. This permission is more of a guarantee . Once assigned, there is no way to remove the user or role. This is only possible by the user or the role itself, as well as by users with the permission \u201cIs database administrator\u201d. The owner permission prevents other users who have the \u201cAuthorize\u201d permission from removing someone with the owner permission from the record.

Nevertheless, there are many scenarios in which the ability to view and use a record should be linked to a release issued in advance. In this context, the seal is an effective protective mechanism. This multi-eye principle protects passwords by securing them with granular release mechanisms. If you want to see a password, this must be requested and released. The release can also be temporary. Relevant rights \u2693\ufe0e The following option is required to add a seal. User right \u2693\ufe0e Can add seal Required permissions \u2693\ufe0e Firstly, the user must have the authorize permission for the record in order to create seals. The read permission to all users and roles that are contained in the seal is also required. The exact configuration of password masking and permissions for records is described in detail in the Authorization concept section . What exactly is sealed? \u2693\ufe0e Technically speaking, the password itself is not sealed. It is the permission to see a password field that is protected by a seal. This allows for the most sensitive configurations, in which one group can use the password without restrictions, but the same password is sealed for other users. The wizard assists users in applying seals, as well as in future maintenance. Be Aware The complete data set is never sealed! Only the permission to view a password is protected by a seal. Be Aware Only records that are protected with a password can be sealed! Seal wizard \u2693\ufe0e All seal configurations are performed in the wizard. Both the application of new seals as well as the processing and removing are possible. The current state of a seal can also be viewed in an overview, which is accessible via the button in the ribbon. When the seal wizard is opened via the ribbon, the wizard appears in the case of unsealed data sets, which runs in four steps through the configuration of the seal. 1. Apply seal \u2693\ufe0e All objects that are sealed are displayed at the beginning. Depending on the data record, this can be one object, or several. It is also possible to use existing seal templates . Optionally, you can enter a reason for each seal. 2. Multi-eye principle \u2693\ufe0e The seal logic is the most basic element of this protective mechanism. Here, you define for which users or roles the record should be sealed or released in the future. All those for whom the record is to be sealed are displayed in red, while all users with the required permissions to issue a release are displayed in blue. Hint All users and roles for which the data set is not sealed and which are not authorized for release are displayed in green. These can use the data record independently of the seal. To avoid having to perform any configuration manually, roles and users are copied directly from the authorizations of the data record. Compare with the \"permissions\" for the record (can be viewed via the ribbon). Supervisors should issue the releases for their employees. Therefore, the checkbox also follows the existing authorizations. The following scheme is used: Hint All users and roles that have the authorize permission to the record are \"authorized to issue a release\" for the seal by default. All users and roles that do not have the authorize permissions to the record are copied directly into the \"Sealed for\" column. Here is a closer look at the permissions of the role Administrators on the record: Adjusting the seal logic \u2693\ufe0e Although standard authorizations are used as a basis for the sealing concept, these can be adapted. The number of releases generally required is as configurable as the required number of releases from a role. In the following example, the seal has been extended so that a total of three release authorizations are required in order to release the seal (Multi-eye principle) . The role of the administrators has been marked in the mandatory column. This means that it must grant at least one release. In summary: A total of three releases must be made, whereby the group of administrators must grant at least one release. In order to be not only dependent on existing authorizations on the data set, other users can also be added to the seal. The role accounting under \"sealed for\" has been added below. Hint When a role or a user is added to a seal, these users also receive permissions on the record according to the authorization granted in the seal. A role that is added under \"Sealed for\" receives the Read permission on the record. When you add authorization permissions, these will include the Read , Write , Delete , and Authorize permission. Be Aware All the roles that were once added to the seal can no longer be removed via the seal logic. This is only possible directly via the authorizations of the data record! Hint It is possible to seal records for a user who is also authorized to issue a release. In this constellation, it is important to ensure that at least one other user is authorized to issue a release. In principle, you should never be able to issue a release for yourself. 3. Advanced settings \u2693\ufe0e Advanced seal settings allow you to adjust the multi-eye principle. Both the time validity of a release request as well as a granted release can be configured. Multiple break defines whether after the breaking of a seal by a user, other users may still break it. 4. Saving the seal \u2693\ufe0e Before closing the wizard, it is possible to save the configuration for later use in the form of a template.

System landscape \u2693\ufe0e The following overview presents a basic production Password Safe system landscape. Version 8 allows the use of several database servers across all sites. These are then synchronized using Microsoft SQL server tools. Any number of application servers can be made available for the client connection. This ensures load distribution, and allows work without significant latency. This technology offers enormous performance advantages, particularly in the case of installations that are spread across worldwide locations. Client (presentation layer) \u2693\ufe0e The client layer handles the representation of all data and functions, which are provided by the application server. Application server (business logic) \u2693\ufe0e The application server is entirely responsible for the control of the business logic. This server only ever delivers the data for which the corresponding permissions are available. The multi-tier architecture described at the beginning allows the use of several application servers and ensures efficient load distribution. Database server (data storage) \u2693\ufe0e Password Safe uses Microsoft SQL Server to store data due to its widespread use, and its ability to ensure high-performance access even in large and geographically scattered environments. Smaller installations may also use the free SQL Express version. Conclusion \u2693\ufe0e At least three servers are thus recommended: Database server (MSSQL) Application server (Password Safe services) Web server (IIS, NginX, Apache 2) Recommendation For databases in a production system, we recommend using a fail-safe cluster. Microsoft SQL Server can replicate the data to a different data centre, e.g via WAN. We also recommend providing a Windows server for each function. Separating the systems makes it easier to expand and scale the system landscape at a later point. However, it is not absolutely necessary to separate the systems.

Installing the SQL server \u2693\ufe0e If the SQL server and the application server are on the same machine, the SQL server should be installed on the new machine first. It is necessary to observe the system requirements for this process. 2. Installing the server \u2693\ufe0e The Password Safe application server is installed next (see System requirements ). The installation itself is described under Installation of the AdminClient . 3. Basic configuration \u2693\ufe0e After the server has been installed, the basic configuration is completed. A new configuration database will be created on the SQL server as a result. If you want to retain the old SQL server, it is necessary to give the configuration database a new name. 4. Deactivating the old server \u2693\ufe0e The license first needs to be deactivated before it can be activated on the new server (see options under License settings . Now stop the server so that nothing more can be changed in the database. Backing up the data \u2693\ufe0e After making these preparations, the data from the old server can be backed up. 1. Backing up the system \u2693\ufe0e If using a virtual machine, a backup of it should be created. The old version of the server can then be restored in the event of problems. 2. Backing up the database \u2693\ufe0e In order to transfer the data to the new server, a backup of the database should be created. Although this is also possible via the AdminClient, we recommend carrying out the backup at the SQL level: right click on the database, then on Tasks and Backup. The desired target folder is selected in the following window. 3. Backing up the server certificate \u2693\ufe0e It is essential that the all available certificates are backed up. Depending on the installation, a different number of certificates are required here. Configuring the new server \u2693\ufe0e After the backed up data (database and certificate) has been transferred to the new server, it still needs to be integrated. 1. Integrating the database at the SQL level \u2693\ufe0e Firstly, a new database is created on the SQL server. This option can be found in the SQL Management Studio after right clicking on Databases. It is usually sufficient to simply enter the database names. As soon as the database has been created, the option Restore (under Tasks) can be selected by right clicking on the server. The Database is thus selected here. The backup now needs to be selected. It is also essential to check whether the correct database has been selected in the field \"Target\". Hint This method can be also used to import backups that were directly created from the AdminClient. 2. Setting up the server \u2693\ufe0e After the backup has been installed on the new database, you can be start the AdminClient and run the setup wizard. The setup wizard is used for (amongst other things) reactivating the license. It is now possible to enter all of the desired configurations for the server. 3. Importing the certificates \u2693\ufe0e The backed up certificates are imported via the certificate manager . 4. Integrating the database \u2693\ufe0e Finally, the database is integrated onto the server via the database wizard .

This does not only involve fixing any problems but also primarily the development of new features to adapt the software as best as possible to the requirements of our customers. Therefore, it is recommended that you regularly install updates. The documentation always refers to the latest version available. If Password Safe deviates from the documentation (e.g. in appearance or also its functional scope), it makes sense to firstly update to the latest version. Hint The update check on the server or the client can be used to easily install the latest version. The update check on the client must be activated in the settings for users beforehand. We recommend leaving the update check deactivated for normal users! Otherwise these users could independently attempt to install updates. Since a new client cannot connect to an old server, this results in the user not being able to log in. Requirements \u2693\ufe0e The requirements should be checked or established before an update. Be aware Please always check the Changelog for requirements or breaking changes before updating! Check the software maintenance package \u2693\ufe0e The right to install updates is acquired with the software maintenance package. It is important to note that you are permitted to install all updates as long as the software maintenance package is still active. If the software maintenance package has expired, you are only permitted to use those versions that were released during the term of the software maintenance package. Therefore, you should check whether the software maintenance package is still active before an update. This can be easily checked on the AdminClient under License settings . Creating a backup \u2693\ufe0e An update always involves making a profound change to the existing software. A corresponding Backup should thus be created directly before the update to ensure that no data is lost if a serious problem arises. Checking compatibility \u2693\ufe0e An attempt is always made to design the AdminClient so that it is backwards compatible. Unfortunately this is not always possible. Therefore, you should always check which client version the AdminClient is compatible with before an update. The version history for the relevant version will provide this information. Danger If the password for logging in to the AdminClient on the database has been saved, it is essential that it is noted down or temporarily saved elsewhere before an update! Latest installation files \u2693\ufe0e The installation files can be downloaded from the customer information system . Please simply use the access data that we sent to you by email to log in. Perform update \u2693\ufe0e Updating the AdminClient \u2693\ufe0e The AdminClient is simply installed on top of the existing installation. The password from the Admin Client should be made available at this point in any case. After the installation of the Admin Client, the database is only accessible when it is activated. If the password is only in the Password Safe, it should be temporarily stored at this point. Hint If the service has not been ended in advance, the installation wizard will give you the opportunity to do so. If the service is still not ended at this stage, the computer will then need to be restarted. It is thus recommended that the Password Safe services are ended before the update. Further information on the installation wizard can be found in the section Installation of the AdminClient . Patch level update for the databases \u2693\ufe0e The databases are usually deactivated after updating the AdminClient because they do not yet have the corresponding patch level. This should be immediately checked. After logging in to the AdminClient, the module \u201cDatabases\u201d is immediately visible. If the databases have been deactivated, you can reactivate them directly in the ribbon via the corresponding button. The patch level will be updated during this process. Updating the client \u2693\ufe0e The updates for the client are also simply installed over the existing installation. Further information can be found in the section Installation of the client. Naturally, the update can also be carried out using the installation parameters. Updating the WebClient \u2693\ufe0e The application server must firstly be updated. A new WebClient is then created according to the instructions for the web server being used. The document directory on the web server should now be completely emptied. The WebClient is then unzipped and copied to the document directory on the corresponding web server. Be aware If the WebClient is being operated on an IIS web server, a new config.bat is generated for creating the new version. This must not be executed if the WebClient has already been installed and it must be deleted without fail after a successful update. Hint If the WebClient is used, the module: proxy_wstunnel must be installed when using Apache. With IIS the WebSocket Protocol becomes necessary. Further information can be found in the chapter System requirements for WebClient.
