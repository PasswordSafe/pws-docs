You can search for passwords in the add-on, transfer them to the clipboard or enter them in the input mask of the website automatically. The automatic login may require applications. In order to provide the data, the add-on needs a connection to the database. This can be set up in two ways, either via the \"SSO Agent\" or directly in server mode. Currently, add-ons are available for the following browsers: Microsoft Edge Google Chrome Mozilla Firefox Safari Installation \u2693\ufe0e Please find more information about the installation on: Installation Browser Add-ons Connection via SSO agent or server mode \u2693\ufe0e If the installation of the add-on has been carried out, the user can now open the desired browser. A window appears in which the security of the connection is confirmed. Pairing is performed with a simple click. The add-on is authorized to request data from the SSO Agent from this point onwards. A new icon will also be displayed in the desired browser from this point onwards: If the icon is displayed as shown, it means that although the add-on has been installed, a connection has not yet been established with the SSO agent. Only after logging into the agent (via the icon in the system tray) will you receive a Windows notification about the successful login. If a connection to the agent has been established, the number of available records for the current website will be directly displayed on the icon. The following picture explains the exact procedure for connecting in detail: After successful connection, the number of data records available for the current Internet page is displayed on the icon. Database profiles \u2693\ufe0e The server mode must know which database profile it is connected to. There are two ways of setting up a database profile: First, the database profile can be created manually. Therefore, he following information is required: IP address, WebClient URL and database name. Please note that /api is appended to the end of the IP address. It is also possible that the database profile is filled out automatically. For this, you need to log on to a database via WebClient. By clicking on the add-on in the WebClient, its profile can be taken over. Now all necessary information such as profile name, IP address, WebClient and database name are transferred. The server mode benefits \u2693\ufe0e The server mode offers the following advantages: No terminal service is required in terminal server operation SSO Agent is no longer required Be aware Please note that SSO applications only work via SSO agent. If you are in server mode and the SSO agent has not been started, SSO applications do not work! Settings \u2693\ufe0e All settings that relate to the add-on are made centrally on the client. The user settings system can be used to enter them globally per organisational unit or per user. The following options have a direct impact on the add-ons and can be found in the SSO category: Browser add-ons: Automatically send login masks ensures that the login is automatically completed after the access data has been entered. It is thus not necessary to click the relevant button manually About browser add-ons: Automatically fill login masks ensures that access data is entered without the need for any confirmation when a website is recognised. The default browser option also has an impact on the add-ons. This setting defines the browser in which the websites are opened from the client. Note It is important to note that the login mask for records with password masking will be \u201dsent automatically*, even if the setting Browser add-ons: Automatically send login masks has been deactivated. Working with add-ons \u2693\ufe0e Note A record can only be used for entering data if it has a form field of type \"URL\". The subscript number mentioned in the previous section is only available with active logins and therefore already says a lot about the \u201cNumber of possible entries\u201d. For example, if the number \u201c2\u201d is shown, you can directly select the account you want to log in with. Previously, the prerequisite was that you had to navigate manually to the precise website via the browser that you actually wanted to use. This navigation can now also be handled by Password Safe \u2013 as described in the following section. Search and navigation \u2693\ufe0e It is currently assumed that the user has to navigate manually to the website on which they want to automatically enter login data. This way of working is possible but is not convenient enough. The add-on can be used in a similar way to bookmarks. The search field can be used to search for the record in the database. The prerequisite is again that the record contains a URL. The screenshot shows that the URL and the name of the record (Wikipedia) are searched. The results for the search are displayed and can be selected using the arrow buttons or the mouse. The selected website will be opened in a separate tab. Several passwords for one website \u2693\ufe0e If a user opens a page and multiple passwords with the autofill function are possible for this website, no entries will be made unlike in older versions. Instead, the following message appears in a pop-up: However, if the autofill function is only activated for one password but multiple passwords are possible, the password with the autofill function is entered.

Various types are available, such as Remote Desktop ( RDP ), Secure Shell ( SSH ), general applications ( SSO ) and web applications. The Single Sign On Engine offers countless configuration options to enable automatic logon to almost any kind of software. Automatic logins to websites are covered by the SSO agent . The four types of applications \u2693\ufe0e Password Safe varies between four different types of applications: RDP, SSH, SSO and web applications. In terms of how they are handled, RDP and SSH applications can be covered together. Both types of application can be (optionally) \"embedded\" in Password Safe. The relevant session then opens in its own tab in the reading pane . All other forms of automatic logins are summarized in the SSO applications and web applications categories. How exactly these logins are created and used is covered in the next section and in the web applications chapter. They include all forms of Windows login masks and also applications for websites. In contrast to RDP and SSH applications, they cannot be started embedded in Password Safe but are instead opened as usual in their own window. These SSO applications need to be defined in advance. In Password Safe, this is also described as learning the applications . In contrast, RDP and SSH can be both completely defined and also started within Password Safe. RDP and SSH \u2693\ufe0e A new RDP/SSH application can be created via the ribbon or also the context menu that is accessed using the right mouse button. A corresponding form opens in each case where the variables for a connection can be defined. These variables also correspond precisely to those (using the example of RDP here) that can be configured when creating an RDP connection via \u201cmstsc\u201d. Whether the connections should be started in a tab, full screen mode or in a window can be defined in the field \"window mode\" . Working with RDP and SSH applications \u2693\ufe0e If you have created e.g. an RDP connection, this can now also be directly started via the ribbon. The connection to the desired session can be established via the icon Establish RDP connection . Password Safe now attempts to log in to the target system with the information available. Data that are not saved in the form will be directly requested when opening the session. It is thus also possible to only enter the IP address and/or the password after starting the Password Safe application. If all data has been retrieved, the RDP session will open in a tab \u2013 if so defined (Window mode field in the application): Logging in via SSH certificates \u2693\ufe0e It is also possible to complete the authentication process using SSH certificates. For this purpose, the certificate is saved as a document in .ppk format. (It may be necessary to firstly approve this file ending in the settings). The document is then linked to the record via the footer. The record does not need to have a password. However, it is necessary for the record to be linked to a SSH application. Linking records and applications \u2693\ufe0e The application defines the requirements for the desired connection and also optionally for the target system. By linking records with applications, the complete login process can be automated. If the record now also supplies the user name and password, all of the information required for the login is available. Applications and records are linked via the \"Start\" tab in the ribbon. If this link to a record is established, a 1-click login to the target system is possible. The following example illustrates this process using an RDP connection: A record can also be linked to multiple target systems in this manner. The user name and record are supplied by the record, while all other information necessary for the login is supplied by the different applications. In the following example, a record (user name and password) is linked to multiple access points. This is generally a very common scenario. Nevertheless, it should be noted that accessing multiple servers with one single password is questionable from a security standpoint. It is generally recommended that a unique password is issued for every server/access point. Hint It is possible to leave the IP address field empty in the application. If an IP address field exists in the linked record then this address will be used. If there is also no IP address in the record, a popup window will appear in which the desired IP address can be entered manually. Alternatively, it is possible to connect several records with one RDP connection.

The following example illustrates this process using an RDP connection: A record can also be linked to multiple target systems in this manner. The user name and record are supplied by the record, while all other information necessary for the login is supplied by the different applications. In the following example, a record (user name and password) is linked to multiple access points. This is generally a very common scenario. Nevertheless, it should be noted that accessing multiple servers with one single password is questionable from a security standpoint. It is generally recommended that a unique password is issued for every server/access point. Hint It is possible to leave the IP address field empty in the application. If an IP address field exists in the linked record then this address will be used. If there is also no IP address in the record, a popup window will appear in which the desired IP address can be entered manually.

The module enables complex structures to be defined, which later form the basis for the systematic storage of data. It is often possible to define them on the basis of already existing organization diagrams for the company or department. It is also possible to use other criteria, such as the function / activity performed, as the basis for creating hierarchies. It is always up to the customer themselves to decide which structure is most useful for the purpose of the application.

The following section will focus on only those elements of the ribbon that differ. The remaining actions have already be explained for the password module. New organizational unit/user : New organizational units or new users can be added via the ribbon, the keyboard shortcut \"CTRL + N\" or also the context menu that is accessed using the right mouse button. Due to its complexity, there is a separate section for this function: New organizational structures / new users Drag & Drop : If this option has been activated, it is possible to move users or organizational units in list view via drag & drop Permissions : The configuration of permissions within the organizational structure is important both for the administration of the structure and also as the basis for the permissions in accordance with inheritance from organizational structures . The benefits of predefining rights are explained in a separate section . Settings : The settings can be configured for both users and also organizational units. More information on user settings\u2026 Active Directory : The connection to Active Directory (available from the Enterprise Edition upwards) is explained in a dedicated section Azure Active Directory : The connection to Azure Active Directory (available from the Enterprise Edition upwards) is explained in a dedicated section Multi Factor authentication : Additional security during login is provided through positive authentication based on another factor. More on this subject\u2026 Reset password : Administrators can reset the passwords with which users log in to Password Safe to a defined value. Naturally, this is only possible if the connection to Active Directory is configured via end-to-end encryption .

This may take some time, depending on the amount of import data. If the import was terminated, this is symbolized by a hint. Imported users and organizational units \u2693\ufe0e The users and organizational units imported in Masterkey mode cannot be edited in Password Safe. Therefore, any changes must be made in AD and synchronized. AD thus becomes the leading system. Affiliations to roles are also synchronized and must be set in the AD.

All with the \"authorize\" right None All with the \"authorize\" right Hint If a user is imported, he will be given those roles that he also had in AD insofar as these roles already exist in Password Safe or have also been imported. Logging into Password Safe \u2693\ufe0e Users who are imported using this mode can log in with the domain password. Please note that no domain needs to be specified when logging in. Of course, the login process can also be supplemented with multifactor authentication . Hint Logging on using Kerberos works \"automatically\". As long as the corresponding Kerberos server is accessible, the users in the domain authenticate themselves via Kerberos using their domain password. If the logon via Kerberos does not work \u2013 e.g. due to incorrect configuration of the domain controller \u2013 the logon via the NTLM protocol is attempted. However, these are all settings that have to be made on the domain controller and have nothing to do with Password Safe. Be Aware Logging on to Password Safe using SSO via Kerberos is currently not possible. Permissions to imported objects \u2693\ufe0e The rights to be issued to imported users are explained in the following example: In Master Key mode, all users will be issued with the read right. The responsible user will be issued with all rights and the key. This ensures that he can also synchronize or change the user in the future Other responsible users are issued with the same rights as the responsible user The Master Key for the Active Directory profile will also be issued with all rights and keys as it will be used for the synchronization Finally, users will be issued with the rights for themselves Hint All users and roles issued with rights to the imported object also receive its rights key. Synchronization \u2693\ufe0e During synchronization, all relevant information for users, organizational units and roles (names, email, etc.) is updated. Changed affiliations for roles are adjusted. Likewise, users are activated or deactivated according to the settings in the AD. If the membership of organizational units is to be changed, this can be done by Drag & Drop . New users and correspondingly defined roles are imported. Hint If the tick was not set in the Synchronization column when a user is imported, no changes are made. Manual synchronization \u2693\ufe0e The synchronization can be started manually at any time via the corresponding button in the ribbon. Select the required profile and start the synchronization. As is the case with the initial import, the synchronization runs in the background. A hint indicates that the process has been completed. Synchronization via system tasks \u2693\ufe0e The synchronization can also be carried out automatically. This is made possible via the system tasks . Deleting or removing users \u2693\ufe0e If a user is deleted in Active Directory, it is also deleted in Password Safe during the next synchronization. For this purpose, it is necessary for the user to be imported as a synchronizable user. If the user is only deleted from Password Safe but retained in Active Directory, a synchronization needs to be carried out to delete it from the database. For this purpose, the wizard is called up via import . The first step is to select an organizational unit. This has no effect when simply deleting a user. The second step is to search for the user. Both ticks are removed. After checking the summary, the process is concluded. The synchronization is completed and the user is deleted from the database.","title":"Masterkey mode"},{"location":"configuration/client-modules/organizational_structures/active_directory_link/masterkey_mode/#masterkey-mode","text":"","title":"Masterkey mode"},{"location":"configuration/client-modules/organizational_structures/active_directory_link/masterkey_mode/#maximum-convenience","text":"In contrast to end-to-end mode , which places the main focus on security, Masterkey mode provides the maximum level of convenience.

The Passwords module provides administrators and users with central access to the passwords for the purpose of handling this sensitive data that requires protection. Search filters in combination with color-highlighted tags enable very focussed work. Various approaches can be used to help apply the desired permissions to objects. Furthermore, the ergonomic structure of the module helps all users to use Password Safe in an efficient and targeted manner. Prerequisite \u2693\ufe0e The following user right is required for adding new passwords: Can add new passwords Module-specific ribbon functions \u2693\ufe0e The ribbon offers access to all possible actions relevant to the situation at all times. Especially within the \"Passwords\" module, the ribbon plays a key role due to the numerous module-specific functions. General information on the subject of the ribbon is available in the relevant section. The module-specific ribbon functions will be explained below. New \u2693\ufe0e New password : New passwords can be added via this icon in the ribbon, via the context menu that is accessed using the right mouse button and via the shortcut (Ctrl + N). The next step is to select a suitable form . Open : Opens the object marked in list view and provides further information about the record in the reading pane . Delete : Deletes the object marked in list view . A log file entry is created (see logbook ). Reveal : The function Reveal can be used for all records that have a password field. The passwords in the reading pane will be revealed. In the example, the passwords have been revealed and can be hidden again with the Hide button. Actions \u2693\ufe0e Notifications : Defining notifications enables a constant flow of information about any type of interaction. The issuing of notifications is carried out in the module designed for this purpose. Duplicate : Duplicating creates an exact copy of the record in a new tab. Move : Moves the record marked in list view to another organizational structure. Favorite : The selected record is marked as a favorite. It is possible to switch between all records and favorites at any time. Quick view : A modal window opens for the selected record for 15 seconds and displays all available information including the value of the password . Change form : It is possible to change the form used for individual records. \"Mapping\" of the previous form fields can be directly carried out in the process. Permissions \u2693\ufe0e Permissions : The drop-down menu can be used to set both password permissions and also form field permissions. This method only allows the manual setting of permissions for data (see authorization concept ). Password masking : Masking passwords that need to be protected from unauthorized users is an important feature of the security concept in Password Safe. Seal : The multi-eye principle in Password Safe is covered in its own section. Seals . Clipboard \u2693\ufe0e The clipboard is a key element in the ribbon. This only exists in the \"Passwords\" module. Clicking on the desired form field for a record in the ribbon will copy it to the clipboard. The message in the style of the \"Balloon Tips\" in Windows shows that the password has now been saved in the clipboard for 300 seconds. (Note: the time until the clipboard is cleared is 60 seconds by default. In the present case, this has been adjusted via the user settings.) Start \u2693\ufe0e Conveniently working with passwords is only possible via the efficient usage of automated accesses via RDP, SSH, general Windows applications or websites. This makes it possible to dispense with (unsecure) entries via \"copy & paste\". Open web page : If an URL is saved in the record, this menu option can be used to directly open it. Applications : If applications have been linked to records, they can be directly opened via the \"start menu\". Extras \u2693\ufe0e Create external link : This option creates an external link for the record marked in list view. A number of different options can be selected: Be Aware If several sessions are opened on a client, an external link is always called in the first session. History : This icon opens the history for those records selected in list view in a new tab. Due to the comprehensive recording of historical versions of passwords, it is now possible to compare several versions with one another. Print : This option can be used to open the print function. Export : It is possible to export all the selected records and also the data defined by the filter to a .csv file. Change form : This option can be used to assign a new form to the selected passwords. Settings : The password settings are described in a separate section.

The basic concept is based on only a few rules which always apply without exception. Despite the innumerable individual adjustment screws, these basic rules can be summarized in three essential steps. 1. Permissions only for users or roles \u2693\ufe0e If the permission for a data record is to be defined, there are basically only two possibilities: Permission for a user Permission for a role A role is technically nothing more than a summary of multiple users with the same permissions. It is, of course, a good idea to manage these roles in accordance with your company\u2019s activities. The role \u201cAdministrators\u201d can therefore be provided with more extensive authorizations than, for example, the role \u201cSales Assistance\u201d. This role-based inheritance allows the organization to maintain the overview in a larger corporate structure as well as a simple procedure when adding new employees. Instead of having to entitle him individually, this is simply added to his role. It is obvious to proceed with the organization of accesses using the concept of roles as a basis and only to grant rights individually to employees in exceptional cases. The unplanned absence of personnel must also be taken into account in such concepts. Working with roles defuses such risks significantly. Note Permissions are always granted to only one user or role! 2. Membership in roles \u2693\ufe0e The key point is membership in a role. If an employee can use the authorizations according to the roles assigned to him, he must be a member of the role . Only members see the records that have been authorized for the role. Note A small technical digression into the nature of the encryption can be very helpful with the basic understanding. Each role has a key pair. The first key is used to encrypt data. Access to this information is only possible with the second key. The membership in a role is equivalent to this second key. 3. Membership vs. permissions for roles \u2693\ufe0e The admin user in Password Safe must pay particular attention to the interplay between users and roles. This dynamics is crucial for understanding the concept of authorization, in order to ensure maximum software adaptability to any corporate structure. The following diagram illustrates this with an example of two users. User 1 is a member of the role, and is therefore authorized for all records that are assigned to the role. However, it has only \u201cread rights\u201d for the role itself. This means, it can see the role, but cannot \u201cEdit, move, or delete\u201d it. User 2 has all rights for the role. It can add additional users to the role by means of \u201cauthorize\u201d. The crucial point, however, is that it is not a member of the role. It cannot, therefore, see any records for which the role is authorized. In practice, the first user would be a classic user that is assigned, for example, to the Sales role by the administrators, and can view the records accordingly. The second user could be one of those administrators. This user has extensive rights for the role. It can edit it, and add users to it. However, it cannot see any data that is assigned to sales. It lacks membership in the role. Note As a member of a role, it must have at least the \u201cread\u201d right for the role! Specific example and configuration \u2693\ufe0e Similar to the previous section Membership vs. permissions for roles , the configuration of a role will be illustrated using two users. The configuration is performed in the \"Roles\" module . By double-clicking on the role \u201cIT-Consultants\u201d in the list view , you can open their detailed view. The user \u201cHolste\u201d is a member of the role and can, therefore, access those records for which the role has permissions . He has the obligatory read right for the role, which is the basic requirement in order to be a member of the role. Which exact rights it has to the data record is not defined within the role! This is set out in the following section . The user \u201cAdministrator\u201d has all rights to the role, but is not a member! Thus, it cannot see any records that are authorized for the role. However, it has all rights to the role and can therefore print, assign other users to the role, and delete them. This example clearly shows the advantages of the concept. The complete separation of administrative users from regular users brings significant advantages. Of course, one does not necessarily exclude the other. An administrator can, of course, have full access to the role and also be a member in it! The boundaries between the two often overlap, and can be freely defined in Password Safe.","title":"Permission concept and protective mechanisms"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/#permission-concept-and-protective-mechanisms","text":"","title":"Permission concept and protective mechanisms"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/#what-is-the-permission-concept","text":"With Password Safe version 8 we provide the right solution to all conceivable demands placed on it with regards to permission management.

This method of setting permissions is thus carried out separately for every record \u2013 this process is not as recommended for newly created data. If you want to work effectively in the long term, the automatic setting of permissions should be used. However, the manual setting of permissions is generally used when editing already existing records. Adding additional users with permissions \u2693\ufe0e In the previous section, it was clarified that permissions are granted either directly to the user or to several users grouped in a role. With this knowledge, the permissions can be set manually. In the \"Passwords\" module , there are three different ways to access the permissions in the list view: Icon in the ribbon Context menu of a data record (right-click) Icon at the right edge of the reading pane Note The icon on the right of the reading pane shows the information whether the record is personal or public. In case of personal data records, the user that is logged on is the only one who has permissions! The author is created with all permissions for the record. As described in the Permission Concept , you can now add roles and users. 'Right click - Add' inside the userlist or use the ribbon \"User and roles\" to add a user. The filter helps you to quickly find those users who should be granted permissions for the record in just a few steps. The search filter opens in a separate tab and can be configured as usual. Multiple selection is also enabled. It allows to add several users via the Windows standard Ctrl/Shift + left mouse button. Set and remove permissions \u2693\ufe0e By default, all added users or roles receive only the \u201cRead\u201d permission on the record. The \u201cRead\u201d permission at the beginning is sufficient to view the fields of the data record and to use the password. \"Write\" permission allows you to edit a data record. The permission \u201cAuthorize\u201d is necessary to authorize other users to the record . This is also a requirement for the configuration of a seal . Transferring permissions \u2693\ufe0e A simple right-click on a user can be used to copy and transfer permission configurations of users or roles to others in the context menu. In this context, the use of permission templates is also very practical. In the \u201cTemplate\u201d area of \u200b\u200bthe ribbon, you can save configured permissions, including all users, and reuse them for other records. The transfer of permissions and their reuse can be an important building block to create and maintain entitlement integrity. This method cannot rule out misconfigurations, but it will minimize the risk significantly. Of course, the correct configuration of these templates is a prerequisite. The add permission \u2693\ufe0e The \u201cadd\" permission holds a special position in the authorization concept. This permission controls whether a user/role is permitted e.g. to create a new record within an organisational structure. Consequently, this permission can only be set in the organisational structure module. More\u2026 The owner permission \u2693\ufe0e The \"owner\" permission can be set for a user.

Various mechanisms can be used to select the records to be edited. You are able to select the records in list view or you can use the filter as part of the multiple editing function. Both scenarios are described below. User permissions for batch processing \u2693\ufe0e This mode is inactive by default and needs to be activated in the user rights. Can carry out batch processing for permissions based on a filter Multiple editing via list view \u2693\ufe0e Individual permissions can be added or remove via Multiple editing within list view . The existing permissions will not be overwritten . Selecting the records \u2693\ufe0e In list view , Shift or Ctrl + mouse click can be used to select multiple records. Permissions can also be granted for these records via the selection. The marked records are displayed in a different color. 6 records are marked in the following image. Dialogue for configuring the permissions \u2693\ufe0e A new tab will be opened in the ribbon above the \"Permissions\" button in which the permissions can be configured. The tab will display the number of records that will be affected by the defined changes. Note As the already granted permissions for the selected records may differ, it is not possible to display the permissions here. Adding permissions \u2693\ufe0e To add a permission, a user or role is selected first in the ribbon under Search and add or Search . The permissions are then selected as usual in the ribbon. The symbol indicates that permissions will be added. In the following example, Mr. Steiner receives read permission to all selected records. In contrast, Mr. Brewery receives all permissions. Reducing permissions / removing users and roles from the permissions \u2693\ufe0e If you want to remove permissions, it is also necessary to add the user or the desired role to be edited. Clicking on Reduce permissions now means that permissions will be removed. This is indicated by the symbol. The selected permissions will be removed. Note If the read permission is to be removed for a user or role, the user will be completely removed from the permissions. Examples \u2693\ufe0e In the following example, Mr. Steiner receives read permissions to all selected records. In contrast, Mr. Brewery receives all permissions: The read permission will be removed for Mr. Steiner. As removing the read permissions means that no other permissions exist for the record, Mr. Steiner is completely removed from the permissions. The authorize, move, export and print permissions are being removed from Mr. Brewery. Assuming that he previously had all permissions, he will then have read, write and delete permissions remaining: Batch processing using a filter \u2693\ufe0e In some cases it is necessary to edit the permissions for a very large number of records. On the one hand, a maximum limit of 1000 records exists and on the other hand, handling a very large number of records via list view is not always the best solution. The Batch processing using a filter mode has been developed for this purpose. This is directly initiated via the ribbon. In the subsequent dialogue, you define whether you want to expand, reduce or completely overwrite existing permissions. If you select expand or reduce at this stage, the same logic as for editing via list view is used. No permissions will thus be overwritten. In the option overwrite permissions , the existing permissions are removed and then replaced by the newly defined permissions. Be Aware It is important to proceed with great caution when overwriting permissions because this function can quickly lead to a large number of records becoming unusable. The filter itself defines the selection criteria for the records to be edited. The currently configured filter will be used as default. The records that will be affected by the changes are also not displayed in this view. Only the number of records is displayed. In the following example, 9 passwords are being edited to add the read permission the role \"Sales\". Seals and password masking \u2693\ufe0e Sealed or masked records cannot be edited using batch processing. If these types of passwords are selected, a dialogue will be displayed when carrying out batch processing to inquire how these records should be handled. It is possible to select whether the affected records are skipped or whether the seal or password masking should be removed. If the remove option is selected, the process needs to be confirmed again by entering a PIN. Be Aware The removal of seals and password masking cannot be reversed! Note Depending on the number of records, editing records may take a long time. This process is carried out in the background for this reason. A hint will indicate that the permissions process has been completed.","title":"Multiple editing of permissions"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/manual_setting_of_permissions/multiple_permissions/#multiple-editing-of-permissions","text":"","title":"Multiple editing of permissions"},{"location":"configuration/permission_concept/manual_setting_of_permissions/multiple_permissions/#how-to-edit-multiple-permissions","text":"As part of the manual modification of permissions, it is also possible to edit multiple records at the same time.

Nevertheless, there are many scenarios in which the ability to view and use a record should be linked to a release issued in advance. In this context, the seal is an effective protective mechanism. This multi-eye principle protects passwords by securing them with granular release mechanisms. If you want to see a password, this must be requested and released. The release can also be temporary. Relevant rights \u2693\ufe0e The following option is required to add a seal. User right \u2693\ufe0e Can add seal Required permissions \u2693\ufe0e Firstly, the user must have the authorize permission for the record in order to create seals. The read permission to all users and roles that are contained in the seal is also required. The exact configuration of password masking and permissions for records is described in detail in the Authorization concept section . What exactly is sealed? \u2693\ufe0e Technically speaking, the password itself is not sealed. It is the permission to see a password field that is protected by a seal. This allows for the most sensitive configurations, in which one group can use the password without restrictions, but the same password is sealed for other users. The wizard assists users in applying seals, as well as in future maintenance. Be Aware The complete data set is never sealed! Only the permission to view a password is protected by a seal. Be Aware Only records that are protected with a password can be sealed! Seal wizard \u2693\ufe0e All seal configurations are performed in the wizard. Both the application of new seals as well as the processing and removing are possible. The current state of a seal can also be viewed in an overview, which is accessible via the button in the ribbon. When the seal wizard is opened via the ribbon, the wizard appears in the case of unsealed data sets, which runs in four steps through the configuration of the seal. 1. Apply seal \u2693\ufe0e All objects that are sealed are displayed at the beginning. Depending on the data record, this can be one object, or several. It is also possible to use existing seal templates . Optionally, you can enter a reason for each seal. 2. Multi-eye principle \u2693\ufe0e The seal logic is the most basic element of this protective mechanism. Here, you define for which users or roles the record should be sealed or released in the future. All those for whom the record is to be sealed are displayed in red, while all users with the required permissions to issue a release are displayed in blue. Hint All users and roles for which the data set is not sealed and which are not authorized for release are displayed in green. These can use the data record independently of the seal. To avoid having to perform any configuration manually, roles and users are copied directly from the authorizations of the data record. Compare with the \"permissions\" for the record (can be viewed via the ribbon). Supervisors should issue the releases for their employees. Therefore, the checkbox also follows the existing authorizations. The following scheme is used: Hint All users and roles that have the authorize permission to the record are \"authorized to issue a release\" for the seal by default. All users and roles that do not have the authorize permissions to the record are copied directly into the \"Sealed for\" column. Here is a closer look at the permissions of the role Administrators on the record: Adjusting the seal logic \u2693\ufe0e Although standard authorizations are used as a basis for the sealing concept, these can be adapted. The number of releases generally required is as configurable as the required number of releases from a role. In the following example, the seal has been extended so that a total of three release authorizations are required in order to release the seal (Multi-eye principle) . The role of the administrators has been marked in the mandatory column. This means that it must grant at least one release. In summary: A total of three releases must be made, whereby the group of administrators must grant at least one release. In order to be not only dependent on existing authorizations on the data set, other users can also be added to the seal. The role accounting under \"sealed for\" has been added below. Hint When a role or a user is added to a seal, these users also receive permissions on the record according to the authorization granted in the seal. A role that is added under \"Sealed for\" receives the Read permission on the record. When you add authorization permissions, these will include the Read , Write , Delete , and Authorize permission. Be Aware All the roles that were once added to the seal can no longer be removed via the seal logic. This is only possible directly via the authorizations of the data record! Hint It is possible to seal records for a user who is also authorized to issue a release. In this constellation, it is important to ensure that at least one other user is authorized to issue a release. In principle, you should never be able to issue a release for yourself. 3. Advanced settings \u2693\ufe0e Advanced seal settings allow you to adjust the multi-eye principle. Both the time validity of a release request as well as a granted release can be configured. Multiple break defines whether after the breaking of a seal by a user, other users may still break it. 4. Saving the seal \u2693\ufe0e Before closing the wizard, it is possible to save the configuration for later use in the form of a template. Seal templates can be optionally provided with a description for the purpose of overview.

In this way, the security of Password Safe and the data stored in it is tested in advance in order to be able to offer our customers effective protection and minimize the risk of success of an attack.","title":"Why we test regularly?"},{"location":"installation/","text":"Installation \u2693\ufe0e The following pages will provide you with all the information how to install the different Password Safe components. System landscape \u2693\ufe0e The following overview presents a basic production Password Safe system landscape. Version 8 allows the use of several database servers across all sites. These are then synchronized using Microsoft SQL server tools. Any number of application servers can be made available for the client connection. This ensures load distribution, and allows work without significant latency. This technology offers enormous performance advantages, particularly in the case of installations that are spread across worldwide locations. Client (presentation layer) \u2693\ufe0e The client layer handles the representation of all data and functions, which are provided by the application server. Application server (business logic) \u2693\ufe0e The application server is entirely responsible for the control of the business logic. This server only ever delivers the data for which the corresponding permissions are available. The multi-tier architecture described at the beginning allows the use of several application servers and ensures efficient load distribution. Database server (data storage) \u2693\ufe0e Password Safe uses Microsoft SQL Server to store data due to its widespread use, and its ability to ensure high-performance access even in large and geographically scattered environments. Smaller installations may also use the free SQL Express version. Conclusion \u2693\ufe0e At least three servers are thus recommended: Database server (MSSQL) Application server (Password Safe services) Web server (IIS, NginX, Apache 2) Recommendation For databases in a production system, we recommend using a fail-safe cluster. Microsoft SQL Server can replicate the data to a different data centre, e.g via WAN. We also recommend providing a Windows server for each function. Separating the systems makes it easier to expand and scale the system landscape at a later point. However, it is not absolutely necessary to separate the systems. Accordingly, all of the components can also be installed on one server in the case of smaller installations or test environments.

This does not only involve fixing any problems but also primarily the development of new features to adapt the software as best as possible to the requirements of our customers. Therefore, it is recommended that you regularly install updates. The documentation always refers to the latest version available. If Password Safe deviates from the documentation (e.g. in appearance or also its functional scope), it makes sense to firstly update to the latest version. Hint The update check on the server or the client can be used to easily install the latest version. The update check on the client must be activated in the settings for users beforehand. We recommend leaving the update check deactivated for normal users! Otherwise these users could independently attempt to install updates. Since a new client cannot connect to an old server, this results in the user not being able to log in. Requirements \u2693\ufe0e The requirements should be checked or established before an update. Be aware Please always check the Changelog for requirements or breaking changes before updating! Check the software maintenance package \u2693\ufe0e The right to install updates is acquired with the software maintenance package. It is important to note that you are permitted to install all updates as long as the software maintenance package is still active. If the software maintenance package has expired, you are only permitted to use those versions that were released during the term of the software maintenance package. Therefore, you should check whether the software maintenance package is still active before an update. This can be easily checked on the AdminClient under License settings . Creating a backup \u2693\ufe0e An update always involves making a profound change to the existing software. A corresponding Backup should thus be created directly before the update to ensure that no data is lost if a serious problem arises. Checking compatibility \u2693\ufe0e An attempt is always made to design the AdminClient so that it is backwards compatible. Unfortunately this is not always possible. Therefore, you should always check which client version the AdminClient is compatible with before an update. The version history for the relevant version will provide this information. Danger If the password for logging in to the AdminClient on the database has been saved, it is essential that it is noted down or temporarily saved elsewhere before an update! Latest installation files \u2693\ufe0e The installation files can be downloaded from the customer information system . Please simply use the access data that we sent to you by email to log in. Perform update \u2693\ufe0e Updating the AdminClient \u2693\ufe0e The AdminClient is simply installed on top of the existing installation. The password from the Admin Client should be made available at this point in any case. After the installation of the Admin Client, the database is only accessible when it is activated. If the password is only in the Password Safe, it should be temporarily stored at this point. Hint If the service has not been ended in advance, the installation wizard will give you the opportunity to do so. If the service is still not ended at this stage, the computer will then need to be restarted. It is thus recommended that the Password Safe services are ended before the update. Further information on the installation wizard can be found in the section Installation of the AdminClient . Patch level update for the databases \u2693\ufe0e The databases are usually deactivated after updating the AdminClient because they do not yet have the corresponding patch level. This should be immediately checked. After logging in to the AdminClient, the module \u201cDatabases\u201d is immediately visible. If the databases have been deactivated, you can reactivate them directly in the ribbon via the corresponding button. The patch level will be updated during this process. Updating the client \u2693\ufe0e The updates for the client are also simply installed over the existing installation. Further information can be found in the section Installation of the client. Naturally, the update can also be carried out using the installation parameters. Updating the WebClient \u2693\ufe0e The application server must firstly be updated. A new WebClient is then created according to the instructions for the web server being used. The document directory on the web server should now be completely emptied. The WebClient is then unzipped and copied to the document directory on the corresponding web server. Be aware If the WebClient is being operated on an IIS web server, a new config.bat is generated for creating the new version. This must not be executed if the WebClient has already been installed and it must be deleted without fail after a successful update. Hint If the WebClient is used, the module: proxy_wstunnel must be installed when using Apache. With IIS the WebSocket Protocol becomes necessary. Further information can be found in the chapter System requirements for WebClient.

This does not only involve fixing any problems but also primarily the development of new features to adapt the software as best as possible to the requirements of our customers. Therefore, it is recommended that you regularly install updates. The documentation always refers to the latest version available. If Password Safe deviates from the documentation (e.g. in appearance or also its functional scope), it makes sense to firstly update to the latest version. Hint The update check on the server or the client can be used to easily install the latest version. The update check on the client must be activated in the settings for users beforehand.
