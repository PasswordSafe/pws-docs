# Right templates

## Using right templates

Once they have been configured, permissions can be constantly reused. The functionality *Saving permissions as a template‚Äù in the ribbon is used for this purpose. The templates are globally available and can also be used for other records.

!!! note
    When saving templates, always select a name that will also allow it to be safely differentiated from other templates if you have a large number of right templates.

Nevertheless, the use of right templates merely reduces the amount of work and still envisages the manual setting of permissions. Automatic process for the issuing of permissions also exist in {{about.product}} and will be covered in the section ["Predefining rights"]({{url.placeholder}}) and also under ["Inheritance from organisational structures"]({{url.placeholder}}).
