# Client Module

## What are modules?

{{about.product}} can be customized according to the needs of the users. This requirement can be applied by the user, and can also be applied by administrative users. This means that everyone gets only those functionalities that are necessary for his special work. The amount of features required by an administrator differs significantly from those of a normal user. The **modular structure** of {{about.product}} supports this approach by showing only those specific areas that should actually be used by the respective user.

## Visibility of modules

The modules are the gateway to various features of version 8. Similarly to the features, not all modules have to be made available to all user layers. The **Visibility of modules** can be defined individually within the [user rights]({{url.placeholder}}).

!!! hint
    The visibility of modules can always be adapted to the needs of individual user groups

## Sorting modules

You can access the “Navigation options” via the three dots found at the bottom right end of the module displayed in the client. You can also find those modules displayed there that you have permissions to see in accordance with the visibility settings explained previously but which are hidden e.g. due to the scaling of the size of the client (Application and Password Reset in the example).

The navigation options enable you to define the maximum number of visible elements and also how they are sorted.

!!! hint
    The previously described visibility of the modules is a basic requirement for viewing and sorting them in the navigation options
