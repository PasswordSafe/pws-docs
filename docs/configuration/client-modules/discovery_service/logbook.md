# Logbook

The logbook in the footer of the **Discovery Service Task** is extremely helpful for checking the **Discovery Service Task**. Information about the progress of the **Discovery Service Task** is displayed here. The data is displayed both in the **footer** and also in the **logbook module** (although in more detail here). To display the footer, the user requires the **user right**: [Global settings]({{url.placeholder}}) in the user settings in the category: "Footer area" - "Show logbook in the footer area (activated)"

## Show in footer

The following **events** are displayed in the **logbook for the footer** and in the **logbook module**:

1. New
2. Change
3. Execute
4. Execution completed
5. Error during execution

If an error occurs during the execution of the **Discovery Service Task**, this is also shown n the **logbook for the footer** with **additional information** about the error.

## Display in the logbook

In general, the **logbook module** displays more detailed information about the **Discovery Service Task**. The [filter]({{url.placeholder}}) can be used to select which data is displayed. The same **events** as for the footer for the **Discovery Service Task** are also used here.

The column editor can be used to arrange and display the data in the table according to their importance.
