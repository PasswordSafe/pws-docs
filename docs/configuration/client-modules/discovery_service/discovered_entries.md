# Discovered entries

The entries for the **Discovery Service** are discovered using a **Discovery Service Task**. It can take some time for all the data on the systems for the entered IP network to be collected. This can be easily recognized by the **blue arrow** symbol on the **Discovery Service Task** and a corresponding message is also shown in the General display. Once the **Discovery Service Task** has been completed, the data will be shown in the **Discovery Service module**.

The **Discovery Service Task** needs to be carefully configured. The configurable sections are described below.

1. **Discovery Service Task**: Display of the status: this can be updated in the preview and logbook using the F5 button.
    Red hand: Deactivated
    Blue arrow: Activated and being executed
    Boxes: Corresponds to the assigned tag
2. **General**: The latest information about the **Discovery Service Task** is shown here. A **message** will be shown to indicate an active **Discovery Service Task**.
3. **Overview**: Current data for the **Discovery Service Task** about its progress and subsequent executions are shown here.
4. **Logbook**: The **logbook** can be found in the **footer** of the **Discovery Service Task**. The latest activities carried out by the **Discovery Service Task** are shown here.

!!! hint
    The **data** is **not kept up-to-date while the task is being executed** and does not always show the latest status. Therefore, the data should be regularly **updated** using the **F5 button**!

## Using the Discovery Service entries

The successful execution of a **Discovery Service Task** is a requirement for the **Discovery Service entries**. The discovered data is listed in table form in the **Discovery Service module** and can be correspondingly organized using the **Discovery Service System Task** filter.

In this section, the **Discovery Service entries** that were discovered by the **Discovery Service Task** and selected for the **Conversion Wizard** are displayed.

## Multiple selection of Discovery Service entries

If multiple entries are selected for a **Password Reset**, a corresponding number of **passwords** and **Password Resets** need to be added in the **Conversion Wizard**. Depending on the entries selected (service, Active Directory user, user account), it is necessary to carry out corresponding **assignments** in the **Conversion Wizard** for the **passwords**.

![picture discovery service data selection](/assets/en/client_modules/discovery_service/discovered_entries/discovered_entries_3.png){ loading=lazy }

Every line must be connected to a **password** in the end. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out an assignment process in the **Conversion Wizard** for every entry.

For **Active Directory users**, it is possible to assign an existing **password**.

    The subsequent process is carried out in the same way as when only one **Discovery Service entry** is selected.

## Filter settings

A good filter is required for processing the discovered data. A **filter that has been adapted for this purpose** is available for processing the entries in the **Discovery Service module**. The options in the **filter** are described below:

Description of the **filter with the special options for the Discovery Service entries**:

1. **Discovered type**: The discovered entries can be filtered here according to their type.
2. **Discovered system is resettable**: Indicates whether a Password Reset can be created from the discovered data.
3. **Relevance**: Grading the importance of the discovered system.
    A high relevance means that multiple services have been discovered for an Active Directory user or user account.
    Less important: Exactly one service was found
    Important: Two to nine services were found
    Very important: 10 or more services were found
    If a Password Reset has already been created, the relevance is downgraded to less important.
4. **Transferred as password**: Indicates whether a password can be created via the Conversion Wizard
5. **Transferred as Password Reset**: Indicates whether a Password Reset can be created via the Conversion Wizard
