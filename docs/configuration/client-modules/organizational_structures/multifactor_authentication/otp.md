# OTP (One-Time-Password)

## Using OTP in {about.product}

A one-time password is a password that is valid once and can be used for authentication or transactions. Accordingly, each additional authentication or authorization requires a new one-time password.

## Establishment

To set up OTP in {{about.product}}, proceed as follows.

- **Create form with OTP field**

Create a new form or add an OTP field to an existing form:

- **Create password**

You assign the new or customized form to existing passwords and edit them or create a new password with the new or customized form.

Next, the OTP field must be configured. For this purpose the key (secret) of the desired website/application is stored in {{about.product}}.

As soon as the secret has been deposited and the password saved, the setup is complete.
