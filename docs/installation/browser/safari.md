## Installing the add-on

The Safari Add-on can be downloaded from the following link:
[{{about.product}} Add-on for Safari]({{url.addon_safari}}){target=_blank}.

To install it, simply double-click on the downloaded file. A window will open where you then only need to drag and drop the {{about.product}} logo onto the applications.
