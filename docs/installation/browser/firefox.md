## Installing the add-on

The installation of the Firefox Add-on is done directly from the official Store.
The Firefox Add-on can be downloaded from the following link:
[{{about.product}} Add-on for Firefox]({{url.addon_firefox}}){target=_blank}.

After the download, the add-on is simply dragged and dropped into the browser.

After confirming a security question, it is installed and an icon is created in the menu bar.

!!! hint
    It is also possible to find the Add-on link in the WebClient page footer, if it is not installed yet.
