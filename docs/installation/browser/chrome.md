# Google Chrome

## Installing the add-on

The installation of the Google Chrome Add-on is done directly from the Google Store. You can access it via the following link:
[{{about.product}} Add-on for Google Chrome]({{url.addon_chrome}}){target=_blank}.

Alternatively, you can also access the Google Store via the SSO Agent. To do this, right-click the icon to open the context menu. After a further click on Install Browser Add-ons the Google Chrome Add-on can be selected, whereupon you will be redirected directly to the Google Store.

The installation is started via Add.

The add-on is now installed and the icon is added to the browser.

!!! hint
    It is also possible to find the Add-on link in the WebClient page footer, if it is not installed yet.
