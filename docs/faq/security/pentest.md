# Penetration tests

## External Penetration tests

The high security standards of {{about.product}} are regularly attested by external pentests of different providers. New functions in particular are always subjected to penetration tests in order to have them thoroughly checked before release. The resulting findings enable us to detect and eliminate potential vulnerabilities in advance.

## Why we test regularly?

In pentesting, external and certified security auditors look specifically for security gaps and weaknesses in the software that an attacker could exploit. Attack scenarios are simulated on the client side, the source code is checked and the quality of the cryptographic process is assessed. In this way, the security of {{about.product}} and the data stored in it is tested in advance in order to be able to offer our customers effective protection and minimize the risk of success of an attack.
